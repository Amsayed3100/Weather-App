This is the "Weather App" that is created by me. I've created this project using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. it's a beginner level project but you can know about weather of any city of any country using it.
Here in index.html file  HTML Code and JavaScript code both are included.
@import "tailwindcss"; are included in the input.css file.
